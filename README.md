# Sales_Report
### Excel
In this report for Al-Garhy Company, which I used to work for, I prepared the data using Excel by deleting some duplicates, adding a profit percentage column, etc.
### Power BI
Then after that, I created the report using Power BI to display a comparison between the sales of the two months within the company, to display the highest selling items, a comparison of the profits between each item, and to know the percentage of profit for each item and other charts inside the reports, which helped improve sales significantly in the following month and the coming months after that.
